### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Data Science and Business Analytics** student at **KMITL** (GPA 3.87) with a passion for building intelligent systems. My work focuses on architecting multi-agent workflows, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), and implementing incremental learning techniques. 

I have a track record of winning national hackathons by applying novel solutions like **Knowledge Graphs** and **Zero-shot Detection** to real-world problems in finance and tourism.
