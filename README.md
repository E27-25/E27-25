## 💡 About Me

I'm a **Data Science and Business Analytics** student at **KMITL**, passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world challenges. My work spans **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **agentic workflows**, **knowledge graphs**, and **deep learning** — creating systems that automate complex tasks and transform data into actionable insights.

From **LLM fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)** and **RAG architectures** to applications in **tourism, finance, accessibility, education, and industrial automation** — I thrive on experimentation and turning innovative ideas into practical solutions.

**Current Focus:** Building intelligent multi-agent systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows autonomously.
